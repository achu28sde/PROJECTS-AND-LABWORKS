 Predicting horticultural product demand is very challenging given their perishable 
nature and intricate, dynamic conditions that influence sales. Although classical forecasting 
techniques like SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing have widely been used, they tend 
not to adjust for external factors like weather fluctuations and holidays. In this research, a 
comparative study is done between conventional statistical techniques and sophisticated 
machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), 
LSTM, and ensemble methods such as XGBoost and Random Forests. Feature selection 
techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), were used to improve model 
performance by determining key external and internal variables. The models were learned 
and validated based on datasets of horticultural sales from Germany, including a wide 
variety of products and seasonal variations. The experimental findings show that machine 
learning methods, especially ensemble methods, vastly surpass traditional methods in both 
accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the integration of external factors further enhances 
reliability in forecasting. This study not only highlights the increasing significance of data
driven strategies in agriculture but also provides a route toward reducing waste, optimizing 
stock, and enabling strategic business decisions in the horticultural industry.
